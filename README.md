# The Monkees website (Milestone-project)

My website is about the Monkees rock band ,it consists of 6 webpages : Home: first page of the website , About : Describes the Band and gives little information about the band and its memebers , Gallery:Contains pictures and video of the band , Music (audios): it contains Hits of the band for all the fans that want to listen, Contact:Provides space for the people to contact the band ,Events : Contains the schedule for the upcoming events that the band are going to do. These 6 webpages all represent differents aspects of what we have covered so far in the course.

# UX 

My primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties. 
My page contains all the background information that the people need to know about the band and its memebers , it also allows their fans to watch videos, hear their music and also get the latest information about the upcoming events of the band . Moreover , it provides links to the bands social media such as: Youtube, Instagram, Facebook,Twitter.

1- As a user I want to click a link and not leave the page i am currently in.

# Testing 

I have tested this website using diffent methods to make sure it works properly and give the user the best experience. Moreover, I used websites such as  "www.responsinator.com" to make sure that it works perfectly on different screen sizes.

According to the UX stories the goal was achieved as all pages are opened in new tabs so that the user does not forget where they started. 
for example:  click on one of the tabs such as "about us" and it will be opened in a new tab.

Overview of project on different screen sizes (large screens) :
1-full nav bar. 
2-Images are side to side.
3-Audios (music) are side to side.

Overview of project on different screen sizes (Small screens) :
1-Nav bar becaomes a dropdown menu.
2-Images become one on top of the another.
3-Audios become one on top of the another.

Bugs discovered during this project: 
1-images and audios overode eachother.
2-nav bar did not switch to a dropdown menu when made smaller
